# Number-Guessing-Game_Python
This Number Guessing Game program generates a random number between 1 and 50, and then it enters a loop where the user can input their guesses.

The program keeps track of the number of attempts, provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low, and exits the loop when the user correctly guesses the number. It also checks for invalid input to ensure the user enters a valid number.
